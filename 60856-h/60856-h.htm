<h1 title="">BEAUVOIR
<br /><i>Jefferson Davis Shrine</i></h1>
<p>Beauvoir, freely translated &ldquo;<i>beautiful view</i>,&rdquo; is located on
U. S. Highway 90 about halfway between Gulfport and Biloxi
on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. It was originally part of a tract
of land that James Brown, a prosperous planter of Madison
County, Mississippi bought September 2, 1848, by Contract
and Agreement from John Henderson of Pass Christian, with
the right to build a family residence on it before the title
was cleared. Acting upon this legal agreement, Brown paid
Henderson $900.00 in cash toward the purchase price of
$2,000.00, and gave him a note for the additional $1,100.00,
which was to be paid on receipt of a deed proving his title
to the land had been cleared.</p>
<p>Although the residence and outlying buildings were completed
by 1852, James Brown did not obtain a deed to the
property until July 16, 1855, when he bid it in for $3,000.00
at a Harrison County Court Auction. To this tract of land
he had added, in the meantime, a small piece bought from
the Tegardens for $250.00.</p>
<p>James Brown was said to have been his own architect
and building superintendent for both the Mansion and the
cottages he built on his new home site. He brought slaves
from his plantation in Madison County to do much of the
building; but, for the higher grade of work needed, he employed
carpenters and decorators from New Orleans. The
cypress used was from the Back Bay swamp section, with
most of the timber cut at Handsboro and on the place. The
slate for the roof was imported from England. The buildings
thus planned and constructed were the Mansion, a
Louisiana plantation type house known as Beauvoir House
since the time of its occupancy by the Davis family, one
cottage to the east of this main building and one to the west.
A four room cottage in the rear, which was on the property
when purchased, was used by the owner and his family while
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
the other buildings were being constructed, and later became
the kitchen and servants&rsquo; quarters for the families of both
James Brown and Jefferson Davis.</p>
<p>Information from Mrs. Hobart D. (Olive Brown) Shaw
of Gulfport, Mississippi, granddaughter of James Brown and
the daughter of Joseph W. Brown who was born in this, the
family home on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, explains the practical
use her grandfather made of the two cottages on the
grounds, formerly identical in structure&mdash;the one on the
east, the plantation office, used also as a school room for the
younger children who were taught by a governess; the one
on the west, the Guest Cottage, often called the Circuit
Rider&rsquo;s House from the frequent use made of it by the traveling
Methodist minister in that section.</p>
<p>From September 2, 1848 until May 1873, James Brown
was the owner of the Mansion and its surrounding eighty-eight
acres more or less, either by Contract and Agreement
or by a deed. In May of 1873, after the death of James Brown,
it was sold under a decree of the United States Court for the
Southern District of Mississippi, and was conveyed by deed
of special commissioners to Frank Johnston of Jackson, Mississippi.
Through a special warranty deed given by Frank
Johnston July 7, 1873, Beauvoir became the property of Mrs.
Sarah A. Dorsey, wife of Samuel W. Dorsey.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Sarah A. Dorsey (Sarah Ellis Dorsey) of Tensas
Parish, Louisiana bought the Brown property, she gave
it its picturesque name, &ldquo;Beauvoir&rdquo;. Her ownership of this
beautiful coast property was brief, ending Feb. 19, 1879; but
her use of it, for the most part, during the years she did own
it and her final disposition of it by both will and deed caused
Beauvoir to become historic Beauvoir, and made her worthy
of outstanding recognition for the splendid contribution she
thus made to the welfare of Jefferson Davis.</p>
<p>It was the spring of 1877 that Jefferson Davis, then 69
years old, came back to his beloved Mississippi, seeking rest
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
and a place to write an authentic account of the Confederate
government that he had administered for four years as the
President of the Confederate States of America. It was fortunate
for him that just at that time Mrs. Dorsey, an old
schoolmate of Mrs. Davis and one deeply appreciative of his
great service to the South, invited him for a visit to Beauvoir;
for there he found the place and the congenial atmosphere
ideal for the rest he so badly needed and for the work he had
in mind. He rented the east cottage, now called the Library
Cottage, and fitted the front room with book shelves and
furniture at his own expense. He used the second room for
his bedroom and prepared the third for his son, Jefferson
Davis, Jr. His son made little use of this room, however, occupying
it only a few months in 1877, since he died of yellow
fever soon afterwards in Memphis. It was later used as a
study by Varina Anne (Winnie), youngest child of Mr. and
Mrs. Davis.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Memorial Arch&mdash;Entrance to Beauvoir</i></p>
</div>
<p>After arrangements were made for board for himself
and family, when they could be with him, Davis began work
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
on the history of the Confederate government, which he felt
impelled to write. Mrs. Dorsey&rsquo;s recognition of the value of
such a book to the South caused her to donate her services
for the clerical help Davis had in writing a part of the first
volume of this great two volume history. By this time (April
1878) Mrs. Davis had returned from abroad, leaving Winnie
to continue her studies in Carlsruhe, Germany. From the
time of her arrival at Beauvoir, Mrs. Davis gave her services
lovingly and untiringly as her husband&rsquo;s secretary, until he
finally completed the two volumes, composing &ldquo;The Rise
and Fall of the Confederate Government&rdquo;, and wrote also a
&ldquo;Short History of the Confederate States&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When Jefferson Davis came to Beauvoir he was, as has
been said, &ldquo;A citizen of no land under the sun, proscribed,
misrepresented, and derided&rdquo;; yet he kept his heart free from
bitterness and used the higher mental powers that were still
his in his old age, in writing his invaluable elucidation of the
government of the Confederate States of America from 1861
to 1865.</p>
<p>Twelve years Jefferson Davis lived at Beauvoir. It was
in his second year of residence there, Feb. 19, 1879, that he
contracted with Mrs. Dorsey, widow of Samuel Dorsey, to
buy for $5,500.00 the Beauvoir property, that she had owned
for approximately six years. This deed of sale is found in
Book 16, Harrison County, Mississippi Record of Deeds,
pages 328-329. But, less than six months after the first payment
was made for the purchase of this property, Mrs. Dorsey
died leaving a will dated the previous year, January 4, 1878,
which made Jefferson Davis heir to all she died possessed of&mdash;Beauvoir
and five plantations. But regardless of his inheritance
of Beauvoir through the terms of Mrs. Dorsey&rsquo;s
will, Davis based his claim to Beauvoir on the deed, recording
his purchase of it February 19, 1879. One explanation
found for this claim is that the notes still due on the purchase
price of Beauvoir were paid in liquidating the debts against
Mrs. Dorsey&rsquo;s estate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Among the Harrison County court records is a Contract
and Agreement entered into by the two parties, Mrs. Sarah
A. Dorsey and Jefferson Davis, signed March 20, 1879,
which provided for their joint interest in the Beauvoir vineyard
and orange grove during their natural lives&mdash;same to
be cultivated and gathered on joint account.</p>
<p>The following clause of Mrs. Dorsey&rsquo;s will expresses her
great admiration and reverence for the ex-President of the
Confederate States of America: &ldquo;If Davis should not survive
me, I give all that I have bequeathed to him to his youngest
daughter Varina. I do not intend to share in the ingratitude
of my country toward the man who is in my eyes the highest
and noblest in existence&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This last will and testament of Mrs. Sarah Anne Dorsey
was probated July 15, 1879 in the office of the Second District
Court for the Parish of Orleans, the home State of the
testatrix. It is interesting to note that there was no record
made of this will in the office of the Chancery Clerk of Harrison
County, Mississippi, until Judge A. McC. Kimbrough,
acting for Mrs. Davis in the sale of Beauvoir in 1902, had
the Louisiana records of the probation of the Dorsey will
made a part of Harrison County records of wills.</p>
<p>Due, no doubt, to the provision in Mrs. Dorsey&rsquo;s will for
his youngest daughter&rsquo;s inheritance of Beauvoir if he (Davis)
did not survive her, Jefferson Davis willed this particular
piece of property to his daughter Varina Anne (Winnie).
However, there is no question as to its being in accord with
his own heart&rsquo;s desire to have Beauvoir pass to Winnie who
as a child had been, as he said, &ldquo;His only gleam of light in
that long night&rdquo; while imprisoned at Fortress Monroe; and
who as a young lady had been, as Mrs. Davis said, &ldquo;The harp
of their lonely hearts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Winnie&rsquo;s ownership of Beauvoir was from her father&rsquo;s
death, Dec. 6, 1889 until her death, Sept. 18, 1898, when it
then through her will became the property of her mother.
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
During the years that Winnie owned Beauvoir, both she and
her mother spent much of their time in New York, where
she used her talent as an artist and writer, and her mother,
hers as a writer, as an added source of income. The years
they spent in the North were made more interesting and
enjoyable through their acquaintance and, in some cases,
friendships with certain men and women of like culture and
talents from that section.</p>
<p>When about to leave on a trip to Egypt, Feb. 11, 1898,
Winnie wrote her will naming her mother as heir to Beauvoir.
This will was recorded in Louisiana, Oct. 27, 1898, but
was not put on record in Mississippi until April 20, 1902.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Davis became the owner of Beauvoir, her
failing health and her lack of sufficient income for the upkeep
of the property, and her own needs as well, made it
necessary that she sell this property, which she and Winnie
had always valued more for their treasured memories associated
with it than for its material worth. Proof of the
depth of feeling Mrs. Davis had for Beauvoir as the last and
greatly loved home of her beloved husband, the only President
of the Confederate States of America, is found in her
refusal of the offer of $90,000.00 from those planning to purchase
it for hotel purposes, and her acceptance of $10,000.00
from the Mississippi Division Sons of Confederate Veterans,
whose plans for its use were in accord with the provisions
upon which she conditioned the sale.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the plan originated for the conversion
of Beauvoir into a home for Confederate veterans, and their
wives and widows, great credit is due Mrs. A. McC. Kimbrough
for leaving no stone unturned in her efforts to induce
the Mississippi Division Sons of Confederate Veterans to
make the offer that Mrs. Davis so readily accepted. However,
other UDC members throughout the state had a part also in
influencing the purchase of Beauvoir for a Confederate Soldiers
home and in helping raise the money for the purchase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>

<p class="pcap"><i>Reception Hall&mdash;Extends the Length of the House</i></p>
</div>
<p>The Mississippi Division Sons of Confederate Veterans
took title to Beauvoir on October 10, 1902, and in so doing
accepted the obligation to carry out the conditions imposed
by Mrs. Davis, the most important of which were the requirements
that Beauvoir be used as a Jefferson Davis Soldiers&rsquo;
Home for ex-Confederate soldiers and sailors, their
wives and widows, orphans and slaves, as long as there was
need for such a home; and that Beauvoir House be set apart
as a memorial solely to Jefferson Davis and his family and be
maintained as it was during its occupancy by them.</p>
<p>As soon as the Mississippi Division Sons of Confederate
Veterans purchased Beauvoir, their organization together
with the Daughters of the Confederacy influenced the passage
by the Mississippi Legislature of Bill 179&mdash;Chapter 25 of
the Laws of Mississippi of 1904, which accepted for the State
temporary control of the entire Beauvoir property, and obligated
the support and maintenance of it as a Jefferson Davis
Soldiers&rsquo; Home for Confederate veterans, their wives and
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
widows, without accepting Mrs. Davis&rsquo; provision for the care
also of orphans and slaves.</p>
<p>From 1904 to July 1940 the State continued its control
of Beauvoir in accordance with the provisions set forth in the
Legislative Act passed. But during the months that intervened
between the purchase of Beauvoir by the Mississippi Division
Sons of Confederate Veterans and the State&rsquo;s acceptance of
control of it as a Jefferson Davis Soldiers&rsquo; Home, the Mississippi
Division United Daughters of the Confederacy was
granted permission to take over the property, furnish and
manage it as a Jefferson Davis Soldiers&rsquo; Home for those ex-Confederate
soldiers, sailors, and their wives and widows in
need of immediate care. Mississippi Division records show
that $3,000.00 was expended by the organization for this purpose,
in addition to the necessary furniture and linens donated
for the most part by the Daughters on the Mississippi
Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>In 1903 there was a great need for the Jefferson Davis
Soldiers&rsquo; Home for Confederate veterans, their wives and
widows. In 1940 that need had so lessened that the Mississippi
Division Sons of Confederate Veterans had a bill passed by
the Legislature, authorizing the conversion of Beauvoir into
a Jefferson Davis Shrine, but setting aside the southeast
grounds of the property for use by the State in its continuation
of the maintenance of the Jefferson Davis Soldiers&rsquo;
Home, as long as there was need for such an institution.</p>
<p>According to the decision of the State of Mississippi, the
need for this Confederate Soldiers&rsquo; Home ended June 30,
1956; so the State returned these southeast grounds to the
Mississippi Division Sons of Confederate Veterans, and it became
thereafter a part of the Jefferson Davis Shrine.</p>
<p>The act of the Mississippi Legislature authorizing the
conversion of Beauvoir into a Jefferson Davis Shrine, provided
for the management of the Shrine by a Board of Trustees
composed of six members&mdash;two from the Mississippi Division
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Sons of Confederate Veterans, two from the Mississippi
Division United Daughters of the Confederacy, and two appointed
by the Governor of the State.</p>
<p>In July 1940 the first Board of Trustees of the Jefferson
Davis Shrine began the work of converting Beauvoir into a
shrine. In six months time, February 8, 1941, the restoration
program had progressed so rapidly the doors were open to
visitors. Five months later, June 3, 1941, the restoration plans
were completed; and Beauvoir was formally dedicated as the
Jefferson Davis Shrine.</p>
<p>To accomplish so much so soon and so successfully took
the whole hearted backing of the members of this first Board
of Trustees and the splendid cooperation given by others
from whom information and assistance were sought. But it
must never be forgotten that the real credit for planning and
carrying to completion the program for the restoration of
Beauvoir is due the late Dr. W. A. Evans of Aberdeen, Mississippi,
who was the first Chairman of the Board of Trustees
and Resident Director of the actual work done.</p>
<p>A leading part in both the initial and the follow-up work
necessary to bring about this conversion of Beauvoir into a
Jefferson Davis Shrine was taken by Mr. W. K. Herrin, at
that time Commander of the Mississippi Division Sons of
Confederate Veterans and Mrs. J. P. Pentecost, at the same
time President of Mississippi Division United Daughters of
the Confederacy. Honorable Maxwell Bramlett, State Senator
from Wilkinson County, was in charge of the bill which authorized
the establishment of the Shrine. He also worked
untiringly with the other Sons for the passage of the Bill,
appropriating $20,000.00 for the restoration of Beauvoir as a
Jefferson Davis Shrine.</p>
<p>Through a per capita assessment, the general organization
of the United Daughters of the Confederacy contributed
$5,482.66 toward the restoration. However, the Mississippi
Division accepted a much larger per capita assessment, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
by raising the $55,000.00 thus obligated, paid heartfelt tribute
to Mississippi&rsquo;s greatest citizen, the embodiment of Confederate
ideals&mdash;the first and only President of the Confederate
States of America.</p>
<p>Around 1954 the Mississippi Division Sons of Confederate
Veterans changed the management of Beauvoir by placing
Beauvoir property under the over-all control of their
Board of Directors, and the Shrine proper under a Board of
Trustees, appointed by and from their organization except
one member chosen by them from the Mississippi Division
United Daughters of the Confederacy.</p>
<h3 class="center"><i>BEAUVOIR MARKERS</i></h3>
<p>The granite boulder on the Jefferson Davis Highway,
marking the last home of Jefferson Davis, was erected in
June 1929. It was obtained through the efforts of Mrs. A.
McC. Kimbrough and the generosity of T. A. McGahey of
the Columbus Marble Works.</p>
<p>The marble Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway marker
on Highway 90 was erected in 1944 by the Mississippi Highway
Department. It was dedicated June 3, 1945.</p>
<p>The marker in front of Beauvoir House on Highway 90
was dedicated by the Mississippi Historical Marker Commission
on November 7, 1953.</p>
<h3 class="center"><i>MEMORIAL ARCH</i></h3>
<p>The imposing marble Memorial Arch, serving as a gateway
for the main entrance to Beauvoir, was erected in 1917
by the Mississippi Division United Daughters of the Confederacy.</p>
<h3 class="center"><i>THE APPROACH TO BEAUVOIR HOUSE</i></h3>
<p>Some of the attractive features of the approach to Beauvoir
House are the huge live oak trees, festooned with gray
moss; the few remaining ancient cedars, marking the dim
outline of the once circular driveway; the flowers and shrubs,
planted to simulate the use made of them in the old days;
the broad brick walk, replacing the old shell walk, leading
direct to the fan shaped steps of hand dressed cypress with
hand turned spindle bannisters; the inviting broad galleries,
extending far around on either side of the house; and the
large double doors, with the upper portion small panes of
choice etched glass, serving as an artistic entrance doorway.</p>

<h3 class="center"><i>DESCRIPTIONS of INTERIOR of BEAUVOIR HOUSE</i></h3>
<h4>RECEPTION HALL</h4>
<p>The spacious reception hall that extends the length of
the main part of Beauvoir House immediately claims attention
by its now seldom seen rounded corners, unusually high
ceiling, and beautifully frescoed walls and ceiling done by
the German artist Meuhler, later retouched by a talented
decorator. But there is great interest also in the furnishings,
almost all of which were used by Jefferson Davis and his
family during their occupancy of Beauvoir, and either kept
there or returned later.</p>
<p>The original pieces found here are the two hall seats,
octagon in form, built under the supervision of Mrs. Davis;
the large sideboard, unusual in design, placed here for use
when the guests were too many to be served in the regular
dining room; the silver tray on the sideboard, and the painting
above it, La Bella de Tiziano from a collection of Baroness
Alphonse de Rothschild of Paris; the much admired pier
mirror and console table of rosewood, purchased in Paris by
Mrs. Davis in 1870; the large square table with its fine
marble top, said to have been used by Jefferson Davis while
in the first White House of the Confederacy; and the handsome
mahogany secretary at the far end of the room. Also
of interest in this inviting hall is the painting of Joseph Davis,
favorite brother of Jefferson Davis, sent the Shrine by his
great-niece from New York.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h4>FIRST OF THE DOUBLE PARLORS&mdash;THE FRONT PARLOR</h4>
<p>The Front Parlor used by the Davis family as their parlor
has, as has the back parlor or library, the same rounded
corners, high ceiling, and frescoed walls and ceiling found
in the reception hall. It is furnished almost entirely with original
pieces; but the fine portrait of Jefferson Davis made
after his 81st birthday is not one of these. It was painted by
G. B. Matthews and presented to the Shrine by Mrs. Darling
of New York. At the left of the door is a portrait of Mr.
Davis&rsquo; mother.</p>
<p>The original pieces are the rosewood Knabe piano and
the music book on it, loved possessions of Winnie Davis; the
Davis Coat of Arms, painted by Winnie; the handsome
center table, never moved from Beauvoir; the rosewood sofa
and two armchairs and later the four matching little side
chairs, returned by a great-granddaughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Davis; and the small painting by the piano, done by Mrs.
Davis of the hotel where she last lived&mdash;Hotel Gramatan,
Lawrence Park, Bronxville, New York. It was given by a
faithful servant of Mr. and Mrs. Davis to the UDC Chapter
No. 858 of Chicago, and presented by the Chapter to the
Shrine. The draperies, carpet, small pecan wood chair, and
harp, are not Davis pieces.</p>
<h4>THE BACK PARLOR, LIBRARY FOR THE DAVIS FAMILY</h4>
<p>The Library, used also for daily family gatherings by Mr.
and Mrs. Davis, contains the following furnishings originally
in use there and later returned to the Shrine by Davis descendants
in Colorado; a pair of sofas (gentleman&rsquo;s in leather
and lady&rsquo;s in fabric); marble bust of two year old Samuel
Davis, first child of Mr. and Mrs. Davis; desk with double
section of drawers and the large book on the desk, Winnie&rsquo;s
dictionary. Here also is the large Oriental rug just recently
returned to Beauvoir House. Other interesting pieces in the
room are the cane seated chair, used by Jefferson Davis in
the United States Senate Chamber, and the bookcases, with
grilled doors of heavy wire, filling every inch of wall space.
These bookcases, copies of ones Jefferson Davis saw in use in
Washington, were built and installed under his supervision.</p>

<h4>WINNIE DAVIS MEMORIAL ROOM</h4>
<p>The front room on the right of the reception hall was,
according to Mrs. Davis&rsquo; will, the room of Miss Varina Anne
(Winnie) Davis, &ldquo;The Daughter of the Confederacy&rdquo;. Her
request was that this room and the other rooms of members
of the family, who lived in Beauvoir House, be kept and
preserved as a memorial to each occupant. In planning to
refurnish this front room on the right as a memorial to
Winnie Davis, it was found that only a few pieces of the
original furnishings were left. It was then that the ever constant
lover of Confederate ideals and the exponent of those
ideals, the late Walter Lampton of Columbia, Mississippi and
the Gulf Coast, supplied the money for certain members of
the UDC to purchase the necessary period furniture which
was to be as similar as possible to the suite of furniture
formerly used by Winnie in this room. To this period furniture
was added the following original pieces already there,
or returned to the Shrine by members of the Davis family&mdash;the
washstand, washstand set, two little cane seated chairs,
little slipper chair and rocker, the table, flowers pressed by
Winnie, framed and hung; the book, &ldquo;An Irish Knight&rdquo;,
written by Varina Anne (Winnie) Davis and published in
1888, and one of her favorite books, &ldquo;The Poetical Works of
Sir Walter Scott&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Topping in interest the other pieces in the room is the oil
painting of Winnie hanging over the mantel. It was painted
by the Swiss artist, Rupel, for Mrs. A. McC. Kimbrough who
presented it to the Shrine to make sure that a true likeness
of this favorite daughter of the South would be preserved.
In this picture Winnie is shown in the crown jewels and
robe she wore as Queen of Comus for the New Orleans
Mardi Gras in 1892. She had served as a Maid of this Court
in 1884 when Mildred Lee, the daughter of Robert E. Lee,
was its Queen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h4>MARGARET DAVIS HAYES MEMORIAL ROOM</h4>
<p>The second room on the right is a memorial to Margaret
Davis Hayes. It contains the bedroom suite of burled walnut
formerly used in this room. This furniture had been sent
from Beauvoir after it was no longer the Davis home, and
thirty-nine years later it was shipped back in the same crates
with labels in Mrs. Davis&rsquo; handwriting still on them. The
pillow cases on Margaret&rsquo;s bed were among the linens used
by Mrs. Davis, when newly wedded to Jefferson Davis.
Grouped around the mantel in this room are pictures of
the homes, important in the lives of both Mr. and Mrs.
Davis&mdash;the one in the center, Mrs. Davis&rsquo; girlhood home,
&ldquo;The Briars&rdquo;, in Natchez, where she and Jefferson Davis were
married; the one on the right, &ldquo;Rosemont&rdquo;, at Woodville,
Mississippi, Davis&rsquo; boyhood home; and the one on the left,
&ldquo;Beauvoir&rdquo;, the last home of Mr. and Mrs. Jefferson Davis.
The most important of the Hayes family photographs, making
this room distinctive as a memorial to Margaret Davis
Hayes, is the one of Margaret herself with her baby, Jefferson
Addison Hayes, whose name was legally changed to Jefferson
Hayes Davis to make it possible for the renowned name,
&ldquo;Jefferson Davis&rdquo;, to be passed from son to son for years
to come.</p>
<h4>JEFFERSON DAVIS ROOM</h4>
<p>The rooms occupied by Jefferson Davis and Mrs. Davis,
with a connecting door between, form an offset on the west
side of the house to the left of the back parlor or family
study. Jefferson Davis&rsquo; room faces the Gulf and has the advantage
of being entered from the front or back without
passing through any other room. The furnishings in this
room, that were there when Jefferson Davis was an occupant
of it, are the large rocking chair, the bed, the washstand and
washstand set, towel rack, cigar stand, and the leather foot
locker or small trunk used by him during the Mexican War
and for trips abroad, when ex-President of the Confederate
States of America. Hanging over the bed is a framed garland
of flowers made from pieces of cloth, similar in color to the
flowers copied to make this attractive but unusual piece. On
the back of it is this explanation, written by Mrs. Davis&mdash;&ldquo;Hearing
Jefferson Davis was dying and lacked comforts in
Fortress Monroe, the Southern women made this piece of
work as a cushion cover and sent it to him among other
things. 350 women took a few stitches on this gift sent in
1866&rdquo;. The painting over the mantel is Mrs. Davis as she was
in 1898. The photograph below on the left is Mrs. Davis as
a young girl. On the right is one of Winnie as a child, and
below it, one of Jefferson Davis, Jr., in costume.</p>

<h4>MRS. DAVIS ROOM</h4>
<p>This room, opening into Jefferson Davis&rsquo; room, has the
added attraction of having in it two of the five closets in
Beauvoir House, as well as a north window overlooking Mrs.
Davis&rsquo; rose garden. The original furnishings are the armoire,
sewing machine, spool washstand table, washstand
set, the candle stand or bedside table, and a treasured book,
&ldquo;Manual of Family Devotion&rdquo;, presented to Mrs. Davis by
Bishop C. T. Quintard (Bishop of Tennessee&mdash;1865-1898),
and inscribed as follows: &ldquo;To Mrs. Davis with God&rsquo;s blessing
from C. T. Quintard&rdquo;. The sampler over the mantel was
made by a granddaughter out of a black alpaca dress that belonged
to Mrs. Davis. The wild turkey feather fan, displayed
in a frame, was made for and used by Mrs. Davis. Two interesting
pictures in the room are the picture of the Davis
children made in 1865, and the one of Jefferson Davis, Jr.,
the last one made of him before he died.</p>
<h4>DINING ROOM</h4>
<p>The table, chairs, and large sideboard in the dining room
are original Davis pieces, given to Judge and Mrs. A. McC.
Kimbrough of Greenwood, Mississippi and the Gulf Coast,
when Beauvoir was dismantled. They were kept intact by
them as long as they lived, and by their family after their
deaths. Later, responding to the need of these original pieces
in making Beauvoir a Jefferson Davis Shrine, the Kimbrough
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
family loaned them for use in their original setting. The
painting on the board, forming a part of the mantel in this
small but attractive dining room, was done by Winnie Davis.
Draperies and glass curtains are replacements.</p>
<h4>BUTLER&rsquo;S PANTRY AND CHILDREN&rsquo;S DINING ROOM</h4>
<p>These rooms have been restored to their original state.
In the children&rsquo;s dining room separated from the well arranged
butler&rsquo;s pantry by a partial partition are a round oak
table and chairs in a size suitable for children. The willow
ware seen on the shelves was used by the Davis family when
they lived at Beauvoir. The original kitchen, used first by
the Brown family then the Davis family, was burned about
1927. A covered walkway connected the old kitchen with
Beauvoir House, where the back stairway led to the butler&rsquo;s
pantry for dining room service.</p>
<h4>THE DAVIS MUSEUM</h4>
<p>The front portion of the ground floor has been put to
excellent use as a Davis Museum. Its theme is Jefferson Davis
and His Family. On this same ground floor, just back of the
museum, is a bricked-in room in which the meat was hung
and the wines stored. To the left of this room is the dry well
which served, to some extent, the purpose of a refrigerator.</p>
<h4>OTHER LARGE MUSEUM PIECES ON DISPLAY</h4>
<p>The phaeton, used by Mrs. Davis on her visiting days, has
been loaned by the Kimbrough heirs. Since Mrs. Davis was
short in stature, it was necessary to have special steps put on
the phaeton for her convenience.</p>
<p>The buggy that belonged to Jefferson Davis was purchased
by Dr. A. D. Harmanson, and has been given to the
Shrine by his daughters, Mrs. Pearl Harmanson Atkinson of
Biloxi, Mississippi and Mrs. Lillie Harmanson Marsh of Dallas,
Texas. Near the phaeton and the buggy is Winnie&rsquo;s sidesaddle,
used by her on many rides on her favorite saddle
horse, Kitty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>The boat, Barbashela, is another interesting museum
piece. Captain Boland Leathers, a friend of long standing
of the Davis family, built this little boat for Winnie on the
bow of his steamship, Natchez. He gave it its Choctaw Indian
name, Barbashela, meaning &ldquo;friend&rdquo;. It also is on loan to the
Shrine by the Kimbrough heirs.</p>

<p>During the occupancy of Beauvoir by Jefferson Davis and
his family, this West Cottage was enlarged to serve as their
Guest Cottage. But later, because so frequently used by the
elder daughter, Margaret Davis Hayes and her family, it
became known as the Hayes Cottage.</p>
<p>In the front room of this cottage is an attractive cottage
bedroom suite that was formerly used by Winnie Davis. The
Gulfport Chapter UDC No. 1068 obtained possession of it
and presented it to Beauvoir in 1907.</p>
<h3 class="center"><i>THE LIBRARY COTTAGE or EAST COTTAGE</i></h3>
<p>This cottage, called the Pavilion by Mrs. Davis, was first
used by Jefferson Davis as both his living quarters and his
library. Later, when Mrs. Davis returned from Europe, he
used it as a library and office in combination. It was here
that he wrote &ldquo;The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government&rdquo;,
and a &ldquo;Short History of the Confederate States&rdquo;.
The office chair and desk were returned to Beauvoir by the
Davis heirs. His original desk in the left hand front corner
of the room and the desk in the center of the room were
returned to Beauvoir by the White House of the Confederacy
in Richmond, Virginia in 1956. The easel is the one Winnie
used while painting either inside the cottage, on the porch,
or on the grounds. The book shelves were built under the
supervision of Mr. Davis. The valuable books now on these
shelves are largely Davis family books. Many of them are
autographed by members of the family. Added to this collection
are Volumes I and II of the Memorial Edition of
&ldquo;The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government&rdquo;, presented
by the publishers, Garrett and Massie, for use in the
cottage where the manuscript for the two volumes was
written. It was in regard to Volume II of this great book,
that President Davis&rsquo; friend, Judge C. E. Fenner, said, &ldquo;The
whole argument of secession is practically comprised in the
fifteenth chapter of Part II of &lsquo;The Rise and Fall of the Confederate
Government&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The picture of Franklin Pierce to the left of the period
clock on the mantel was given by President Pierce to Jefferson
Davis, his Secretary of War from 1853-57. The picture to
the right is one of Senator Jesse Speight whose death in 1847
created the vacancy in the United States Senate which Jefferson
Davis filled by appointment from the Governor of Mississippi.</p>
<h4>THE CONFEDERATE MUSEUM</h4>
<p>To the east is the large building that was the hospital for
the Confederate Veterans Home during the many years it
served the Confederate veterans, and their wives and widows.
Today this hospital structure is the entranceway for the home.</p>
<p>This building houses a collection of valued gifts which
has grown up with the home. Many items of historic interest
in this period of history, not directly connected with
the Davis family, were moved to this museum.</p>
<p>Also in this building, an interesting Souvenir Shop is
owned and operated by Mrs. Salome Brady.</p>
<h3 class="center">BEAUVOIR CONFEDERATE CEMETERY</h3>
<h4>WITH A SEMI-HISTORIC GLIMPSE OF THE REAR GROUNDS OF THE SHRINE</h4>
<p>A hallowed spot on the land, comprising the property of
the Jefferson Davis Shrine, is the Beauvoir Confederate Cemetery
where about 800 inmates of the Jefferson Davis Confederate
Soldiers&rsquo; Home lie buried. The grave of Samuel
Emory Davis, father of Jefferson Davis, is near the center,
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
the remains and marker having been moved from the Brierfield
Plantation on the Mississippi River, south of Vicksburg,
Mississippi.</p>
<p>On the way to this secluded but loved burial ground,
visitors pass along the woodland pathway once used by Jefferson
Davis in his frequent walks around the grounds of
this home of his old age. Almost daily in these walks he
would turn off, as the visitors might find it interesting to
do, to the little spring that he loved to sit by for its quietude
and surrounding natural beauty.</p>
<p>Somewhat as it was in Davis&rsquo; time, there are magnificent
trees, some old and many young, bamboo, palmettos, ferns,
wild flowers and other native plants which give the Beauvoir
grounds today the special appeal they have to sightseeing
guests. But of late years, along with this native growth, has
been added an informal planting of azaleas, camellias, sasanquas,
loquats and other flowering shrubs close by the
winding lagoon that has replaced old Oyster Bayou. Further
on toward Beauvoir House is a mass planting of camellias
and shrubs, while on the opposite side is a pretty rose garden,
significant because of its being in the same plot used
by Mrs. Davis for her loved rose garden. It is this combination
of native and cultivated spots of beauty that makes the
rear of Jefferson Davis Shrine in keeping with the front of
it, widely known for the architectural attraction of the buildings
and the almost unadorned beauty of the surroundings.</p>

<p class="revint">1877&mdash;With the failure of this Life Insurance Company, he gladly
accepted Mrs. Sarah Anne Dorsey&rsquo;s solicitous offer of her home,
Beauvoir, as the quiet, restful place needed for concentration on
the books he was writing.</p>
<p class="revint">1879-1889&mdash;Significant were these last 10 years of Davis&rsquo; life&mdash;because
of the completion of his great contribution to the history
of the South, &ldquo;The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government&rdquo;;
his satisfaction and deep-seated emotions over being the
owner of loved Beauvoir; and his sweet contentment and reserved
happiness in being again with his family and seeing, from
time to time, his close friends as well as interested and admiring
associates.</p>
<p class="revint">1889, December 6&mdash;With his wife at his bedside, died in New

<p class="revint">1893, May 28 to May 30&mdash;&ldquo;The Great Chieftain&rsquo;s Last Ride&rdquo;&mdash;funeral
train made a brief stop at Beauvoir before making three
full stops for the body to lie in state in the capitols of Alabama,
Georgia, and North Carolina.</p>
<p class="revint">1893, May 31&mdash;After lying in state in the Capitol at Richmond,
Virginia during the morning, the funeral procession, with Mrs.
Davis and her daughters, Margaret and Winnie, in a carriage
directly back of the caisson drawn by six white horses, slowly
made its way to Hollywood Cemetery, where there and along
the streets leading to the cemetery were gathered at least 75,000
people. A 21-gun salute and taps were the final acts in the burial
of the First and Only President of the Confederate States of
America.</p>

<h4>ORIGIN OF THE BEAUVOIR BOOKLET</h4>
<p>In 1932 members of the three Gulf Coast chapters of the Mississippi
Division United Daughters of the Confederacy conceived the
idea of the publication of a Beauvoir Booklet, proceeds from the sale
of which would be used for UDC projects. Representatives of these
chapters&mdash;Gulfport No. 1068, Beauvoir-Biloxi No. 623 and Beauvoir-Gulfport
No. 621, have revised and enlarged the original booklet as
improvements and development of the Home into a Shrine arose.
This group is now designated in the Division as District V.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><span class="large">THE FLAGS OF THE CONFEDERACY</span></span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="Flags" width="500" height="695" />
</div>
<dl class="undent"><dt>No. 1. The &ldquo;<i>Stars and Bars</i>,&rdquo; the first &ldquo;National Flag.&rdquo;</dt>
<dt>No. 2. The &ldquo;<i>Battle Flag</i>.&rdquo;</dt>
<dt>No. 3. In 1863 replaced No. 1 as the &ldquo;National Flag.&rdquo;</dt>
<dt>No. 4. In 1865 replaced No. 3 as the &ldquo;National Flag.&rdquo;</dt>
<dt>No. 5. &ldquo;<i>The Bonnie Blue Flag</i>.&rdquo;</dt></dl>
<p>No. 1. The &ldquo;Stars and Bars&rdquo; was the first National Flag of the
Confederate States of America. It was adopted by the Confederate
Congress, and raised at sunrise over the Confederate Capitol at Montgomery,
Alabama, March 4th, 1861, where the Provisional Congress
was holding its first session. At the time of its adoption, it was
ordered that a star be added to the flag for each new state joining
the Confederacy. This flag is used as the emblem of the United
Daughters of the Confederacy.</p>
<p>No. 2. The &ldquo;Battle Flag&rdquo; was designed after the first Battle of Manassas,
and afterward was adopted by the Confederate Congress. The
reason for its adoption was that, in battle, the &ldquo;Stars and Bars&rdquo; was
frequently mistaken for the &ldquo;Stars and Stripes&rdquo;. It remained the
Battle Flag until the close of the war. This flag was the insignia of
the United Confederate Veterans, and is now the insignia of the
Mississippi Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.</p>
<p>No. 3. To prevent further confusion arising from the mistaking of
the &ldquo;Stars and Bars&rdquo; for the &ldquo;Stars and Stripes&rdquo;, the Confederate
Congress on May 1, 1863, adopted a new National Flag. This flag
is used as the emblem of the Children of the Confederacy, and is
well worth remembering for its use on Stonewall Jackson&rsquo;s casket.</p>
<p>No. 4. On March 4, 1865, the Confederate Congress again changed
the design of the National Flag. This new design was adopted because
the second National Flag, when hanging limp, looked too
much like a flag of truce. For a time this flag was used as the insignia
for the Mississippi Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.</p>
<p>No. 5. Before the &ldquo;Stars and Bars&rdquo; had been designed and adopted
by the Confederate Congress, a beautiful blue silk flag bearing a
single star, presented at the open meeting of the Mississippi Secession
Convention in the State Capitol at Jackson, Mississippi, January 9,
1861, was the inspiration for the new Republic&rsquo;s first Battle Song&mdash;&ldquo;The
Bonnie Blue Flag&rdquo;. The Irish comedian, Harry McCarthy,
filling an engagement at the Jackson theatre at that time, was a
witness to the thrilling scene following the adoption of the Ordinance
of Secession, and penned the original verses of The Bonnie
Blue Flag as an expression of his aroused emotion. He sang the song
that night to a loudly applauding audience overflowing the theatre.</p>

<p class="revint">37. When it was known that he was to make his &ldquo;Farewell Speech&rdquo; to the Senate in 1861,
the building was crowded to overflowing. He was one of the most gifted orators of
the Congress. At West Point he studied &ldquo;Rawle&rsquo;s View of the Constitution&rdquo; and was
taught that if a state seceded the duty of a soldier reverted to his state&mdash;hence
Davis, Robert E. Lee, Thomas J. Jackson, the Johnstons, and others acting upon this
instruction cast their lot with their States in 1861.</p>
